## bug
<p>
when you run home.jsp file , an error will appear (IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM) cause you can just refreash the page

i set some csv file and i create their function to read the content and show it on the dashbaord admin but it does not work so i maintain the file and i just create 
other ways to store static data like countries and categories (i store the countries in array and the categories in database),and i will appreciate anyone who can 
fix that.
