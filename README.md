## bug
<p>
when you run home.jsp file , an error will appear (IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM) cause you can just refreash the page 
</p>

## problem 
i set some csv file and i create their function to read the content and show it on the dashbaord admin but it does not work so i maintain the file and i just create 
other ways to store static data like countries and categories (i store the countries in array and the categories in database),and i will appreciate anyone who can 
fix that.

<pre>1-The shopping cart carries the set of books that will be purchased, as well as adding modern payment methods, and the process of shipping.</pre>
<pre>2-Paying attention to protection because it is one of the most important things, such as checking the entered data and preventing the upload of harmful files, etc.</pre>
